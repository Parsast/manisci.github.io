Using Graphical Models to extract Meaningful, High quality features From Electronic Health Records
======

I'm focusing on applying some graphical models on **Electronic Health Records**, freely and openly accessible on the Internet, to
extract more **robust features** that can later be pipelined into well know machine learning algoirhtms. Once these new set of features
are confirmed and tested carefully, they may be used for **disease prediction** (classification tasks),or prediction of other
health - related outcomes. 

Tensor Factorization for Phenotyping of patients with Chronic Diseases
======

The purpose of this project was to **obtain novel clusters** of patients features and attributes using Tensor factorization applied on Electronic Healthcare 
Records data. Once these clusters or **phenotypes** are chosen, one can conveniently take adavantage of membership information of each patients and whether 
they belong to a specific cluster, or a set of attributes, in future machine learning tasks, as summarized, less noisy features. The
final outcome being, that once we have more **robust and reliable biomedical predictions**, we may better be able to deliver
appropriate intervention and course of treatment to the patients.
